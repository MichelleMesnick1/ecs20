   	<p>Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua was born in modern-day Benin. Local enemies captured him while delivering messages for a local king in 1845, and sold him to Portuguese slave traders on the coast. Portuguese slave traders sent him to Brazil, where he endured enslavement for two years. His slaveholder, a ship captain, brought him to New York, where Baquaqua secured his freedom with the help of local abolitionists. His biography, published in 1854, is the only known remaining narrative written by a person enslaved in Brazil.</p>
